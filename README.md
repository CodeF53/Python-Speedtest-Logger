# Python Speedtest Logger
A tool to periodically automatically run internet speedtests, logging results.

## Why?
I am currently paying Xfinity for 600mbps down, but only getting 10. Inorder to collect proof of how much I am being ripped off, I decided it would be a good idea to make something like this.
